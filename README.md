# PyBridge-iOS

PyBridge is a C implementation that allows to use Python code in native iOS applications. It allows to send String or JSON messages to the Python interpreter without the need for any web frameworks. Instead of using web applications, you can reuse your Python backend code and implement truly native iOS applications.
